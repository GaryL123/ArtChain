# Artwork-Tracing-Management-via-Blockchain-Technology

Members: Haki Sallaku, Gary LaPicola, Thomas Scardino, Mathew [Last Name]

Description: This project is an application of blockchain technology on the art industry. The idea behind it is to create a blockchain
             in order to keep track of and manage artworks, mainly painting, around the world. The history of the artworks is
             engraved into the blockchain so no matter how much time passes, you can see who had ownership of an art piece and when they
             did. If the artwork is passed on from one person to another, this transaction is also registered in the blockchain. This
             product helps maintin a credible and safe market for art pieces.
